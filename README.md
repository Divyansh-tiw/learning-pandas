# learning-pandas
This repository documents my journey of learning **Pandas** for data analysis in Python.  
I’ll be adding notebooks, scripts, notes, and small datasets as I go.

## 📌 Goals
- Understand Pandas basics: Series, DataFrames
- Learn data cleaning, indexing, and grouping
- Practice real-world data analysis tasks
- Build a collection of examples I can revisit later
